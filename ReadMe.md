Create tiled video thumbnail images with metadata

## About

I was looking for a simple tool to create video thumbnail files, like I created years ago with "Media Player Classic".
In my research I found a few tools for Windows, but only few for macOS and even less (none) open source.

But instead a found the original zsh/bash script from [@zmwangx](https://github.com/zmwangx) and the fork of [@romanwarlock](https://github.com/romanwarlock) which were looking promising.
Since I'm no expert in FFMPEG nor shell scripting I had some trouble adapting the script to my needs initially, but improved eventually.

## Requirements
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
- [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/)

- [Forked project](https://github.com/romanwarlock/thumbnails)
