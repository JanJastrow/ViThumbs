Create tiled video thumbnail images with metadata

## About

I was looking for a simple tool to create video thumbnail files, like I created years ago with "Media Player Classic".
In my research I found a few tools for Windows, but only few for macOS and even less (none) open source.
But instead a found the original zsh/bash script from @zmwangx and the fork of @romanwarlock which were looking promising.
Since I'm no expert in FFMPEG nor shell scripting I had some trouble adapting the script to my needs initially, but improved finally.

## Requirements
- FFMPEG
- Imagemagick

## Sources

- [Forked project](https://github.com/romanwarlock/thumbnails)
